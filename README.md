# ⭐ Ecommerce Follow Along Project ⭐

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## ⭐ Milestone 1: Project Overview

### 🌟 M1. Understanding the MERN Stack
- **MongoDB**: A database for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
- **React.js**: A framework/library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 🌟 M2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend. We'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

### 🌟 M3. Database Schema Design
- We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB.
- A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.

### 🌟 M4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.

## 🌟 Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page Development

In this milestone, we set up the foundational structure for the project and implemented the first user-facing feature: the Login Page. Here's what we completed:

### 🌟 1. Project Folder Structure
We organized the project into two separate directories:
- Frontend: Where the React app lives.
- Backend: Where the Node.js/Express backend resides.

This structure will make it easier to manage the frontend and backend code separately as the project grows.

### 🌟 2. React Frontend Setup
We initialized a new React application to build the user interface. This app will be the foundation for all the user-facing features of the e-commerce platform.

### 🌟 3. Node.js Backend Setup
We set up a simple Node.js server using Express to handle requests and API routes. This server will eventually power the various features, like user authentication, product management, and order processing.

### 🌟 4. Tailwind CSS Configuration
Tailwind CSS was configured to enable a utility-first styling approach for rapid and responsive design. This allows us to quickly style components without writing custom CSS.

### 🌟 5. Login Page Development
The main feature developed in this milestone is the Login Page:
- A functional login form where users can enter their credentials to authenticate.
- Responsive and styled using Tailwind CSS to ensure a modern user experience.

## Milestone 3:

Set up dedicated folders for organizing backend code effectively. Initialized and configured a Node.js server to handle API requests. Connected the application to MongoDB to store and manage data. Implemented basic error handling to ensure smooth server operation.

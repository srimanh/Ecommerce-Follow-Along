# ⭐ Ecommerce Follow Along Project ⭐

Welcome to the **Ecommerce Follow Along Project**, this is a hands-on project where we will build a complete e-commerce application using the MERN stack (Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The goal is to learn how to develop a full-stack web application step by step.

## ⭐ Milestone 1: Project Overview

### 🌟 M1. Understanding the MERN Stack
- **MongoDB**: A database for storing application data in a flexible, document-based format.
- **Express.js**: A backend web application framework for building APIs and handling server logic.
- **React.js**: A framework/library for building user interfaces.
- **Node.js**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server.

### 🌟 M2. REST API Structure
REST APIs are used to allow communication between the frontend and backend. We'll create APIs for:
- **User Authentication**: Allowing users to register and log in.
- **Product Management**: Adding, updating, and retrieving product data.
- **Order Handling**: Managing customer orders.

### 🌟 M3. Database Schema Design
- We'll learn how to design and organize data using MongoDB.
- A schema helps us define how the data is stored and related.

### 🌟 M4. Authentication
Authentication ensures only the right people can access certain features. For example:
- Users need to log in to place orders or see their personal data.
- It keeps the app secure by verifying users' identities.
